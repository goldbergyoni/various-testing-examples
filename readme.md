# Welcome To My Testing Workshop!!
This repository holds various materials, demos and instructions for the workshop


## Preparation
As we meet in the classroom we wish to spend our precious time on interesting development challenges rather than machine setup. Make sure to prepare your machine aforehand. Should you encounter any issue - please open an issue within this repo and I'll be sure to assist shortly

### ✔ 1 Install Node.JS > v10.x
Install Node.JS LTS (any version that is beyond v10) [from this website](https://nodejs.org/en/) - just download and progress within the installation wizard

### ✔ 2 Ensure Node is installed correctly
Open your favourite terminal (Windows: command prompt) and type 'NPM verson'. The output should confirm that version 8.9.x is indeed installed

### ✔ 3 Install IDE (editor)
I highly recommend using VSCode editor in the course as it's lightweight and has a very rich plugins eco-sysem that we might use during our excercise. Simply visit the [downloads site](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and choose the edition that suits your operations system. You may opt for any other editor that supports Node debugging and intellisense

### ✔ 4 Fork this repo
Use git to fork this repo into your computer. You may use the top-right corner 'Fork' button

### ✔ 5 Install dependencies
Navigate to the repository you've just cloned, **change your working directory to 'getting-started'** (cd getting-started) and install dependencies

```
npm i
```

### ✔ 6 Ensure testing works
Run the following command and ensure that the output confirms that all the test succeeded

```
npm run test:exercise

```

### ✔ 7 Polish Your JS Skills
Learning Node requires to be familiar with Javascript. Beside mastering the basic principals of JS, it's recommended to get acquaintance with the following concepts that are highly related to Node.JS:
<br/>
[Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
<br/>
[Spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)
<br/>
[Callbacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function)
<br/>
[Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

### ✔ 8 Prepare your computer for a video call
Install the online calls software [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download), connect your camera and run a [test call](https://zoom.us/test) to ensure your equipment is ready
